MaintenanceTracker
==================

This simple web app is aimed to keep track of oil changes and MPG for your car. So when you fill up, 
enter how many miles you drove and how many gallons of gas you purchased, and MPG will be calculated for you.


TODO
==================
Tie in and send an email to the car owner when oil change is coming up (Base this on miles traveled on each fill up).
Add Mileage tracker for other reasons (Business etc...)
